# qtilerice
the qtile configuration that I use on my machines
add the config.py your .config/qtile folder, put the .xprofile folder in your Home directory and reload your WM. I didn't include my Alacritty config, but I have the opacity changed and imported Dracula colors to it to complete the aesthetic effect.
